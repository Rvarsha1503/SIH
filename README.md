# (Under Development) Welcome to the AI-based Customized Delivery Time Slots Project!

Hello and welcome to our project! We are **Zenith Nexus**, a group of enthusiastic problem-solvers participating in the **Smart India Hackathon 2024**. Our mission is to develop an innovative solution to modernize India's postal services with AI-driven, customizable delivery time slots.

We hope you find our project interesting, and we’re excited to share our journey with you!

## Project Overview

### Problem Number: 169 (Software)

### Problem Statement:
In today’s fast-paced world, customers want more control over their deliveries. To meet these expectations, we aim to develop an **AI-based system** that allows both senders and recipients to customize delivery time slots according to their convenience. 

Currently, **India Post** delivers packages during office hours (10 AM - 5 PM), which often leads to missed deliveries when recipients are unavailable. Our solution will allow senders to select a delivery time during parcel booking, and recipients will have the flexibility to modify this time before the package is dispatched. AI will analyze this data and optimize future deliveries.

### Why is this important?
- **Improved customer experience**: Recipients get packages when they’re available.
- **Reduced failed deliveries**: Optimizing delivery time reduces repeat attempts.
- **Streamlined postal operations**: AI helps optimize last-mile deliveries, saving time and resources.

## Key Features

- **AI-driven delivery time optimization**: The system learns from user data to offer the best time slots.
- **Sender & recipient flexibility**: Both sender and recipient can choose and modify time slots as needed.
- **Efficient last-mile delivery**: Our system ensures fewer missed deliveries by predicting the best times for recipients.
